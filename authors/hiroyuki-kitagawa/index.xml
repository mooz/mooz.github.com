      <title>Compressed Vector Set: A Fast and Space-Efficient Data Mining Framework</title>
      <link>https://mooz.github.io/publication/jip2018-compressed-machine-learning/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present CVS (Compressed Vector Set), a fast and
space-efficient data mining framework that efficiently handles both sparse and
dense datasets. CVS holds a set of vectors in a compressed format and conducts
primitive vector operations, such as lp-norm and dot product, without
decompression. By combining these primitive operations, CVS accelerates
prominent data mining or machine learning algorithms including k-nearest
neighbor algorithm, stochastic gradient descent algorithm on logistic
regression, and kernel methods. In contrast to the commonly used sparse
matrix/vector representation, which is not effective for dense datasets, CVS
efficiently handles sparse datasets and dense datasets in a unified manner. Our
experimental results demonstrate that CVS can process both dense datasets and
sparse datasets faster than conventional sparse vector representation with
smaller memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Continuous Query Processing with Concurrency Control: Reading Updatable Resources Consistently</title>
      <link>https://mooz.github.io/publication/sac2013-transactional-stream/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent trend in data stream processing shows the use of advanced continuous
queries (CQs) that reference non-streaming resources such as relational data in
databases and machine learning models. Since non-streaming resources could be
shared among multiple systems, resources may be updated by the systems during
the CQ execution. As a consequence, CQs may reference resources inconsistently,
and lead to a wide range of problems from inappropriate results to fatal system
failures. We address this inconsistency problem by introducing the concept of
transaction processing onto data stream processing. We introduce CQ-derived
transaction, a concept that derives read-only transactions from CQs, and
illustrate that the inconsistency problem is solved by ensuring serializability
of derived transactions and resource updating transactions. To ensure
serializability, we propose three CQ-processing strategies based on concurrency
control techniques: two-phase lock strategy, snapshot strategy, and optimistic
strategy. Experimental study shows our CQ-processing strategies guarantee proper
results, and their performances are comparable to the performance of
conventional strategy that could produce improper results.&lt;/p&gt;
